This is how the application works :

- All commands start with /books
- You can get a list of all the available books with the /list command
- Use /add{name}/{author}/{editor} to add a new book to the bookstore 
- Use /update/{id} to update a book's data
- Use /delete/{id} to delete a book from the bookstore
